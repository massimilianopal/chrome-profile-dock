## About

On macOS, it's not possible to pin individual Chrome profiles to the Dock by default.  
**Chrome Profile Dock** solves this by creating standalone apps for each Chrome profile, making it easy to launch them directly from the Dock.

No external dependencies.  
No complicated setup.  
Just fast, clean, native-style Chrome profiles on your Dock!

---

## Features

- Create standalone `.app` versions of your Chrome profiles
- Automatically embed a custom icon into each app
- Lightweight and fast
- Compatible with macOS Ventura, Sonoma, Sequoia (tested)
- No need to install extra software (no `dockutil`, no scripts)
- DMG installer available

## Installation

1. [Download the latest `.dmg` release](#)

## Usage

1. Launch **Chrome Profile Creator**.
2. Choose where to save the new Chrome profile apps.
3. The tool will scan your installed Chrome profiles automatically.
